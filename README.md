### Mouse Protein Analysis
In the respective study, Expression levels of 77 proteins were measured in the cerebral cortex of 8 classes of control and Down syndrome mice exposed to context fear to condition, a task used to assess associative learning.
Essentially, we are doing two analyses i.e., multi-class classification and Feature subset study using PCA and Feature extraction for 3 significant learning outcomes.
Firstly, we tried to extract features (genes) that were potentially responsible for a particular learning outcome and tried to compare our results with the previous studies using Filtration and extraction methods to select features of defined learning outcomes, and then we qualitatively isolated features from PCA.
Secondly, for multi-class classification, the initial pre-processing involves handling missing values, sub-setting data for classification, and reducing features for improving our analysis. We used 4 models for classification analysis – Naïve Bayes, ANN, Multinomial logistic regression, and randomForest for the stacked learner. For evaluation, we monitored metrics such as accuracy, precision, F1-score, ROC curve, and AUC for all the models and choose the ideal model that generalizes the data set and reflects the best performance by considering the above metrics.
