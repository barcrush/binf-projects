# Abstract

Welcome to `myProjects` repo, here you will find a wide variety of projects related to Bioinformatics & Data science.

### 1. Model ENCODE data
In this short project, 


### 2. Mouse Protein Analysis
In the respective study, Expression levels of 77 proteins were measured in the cerebral cortex of 8 classes of control and Down syndrome mice exposed to context fear to condition, a task used to assess associative learning.
Essentially, we perfomed two analyses i.e., Feature subset (using PCA and Feature extraction) and Multi-classification study (using base and Ensemble learners) for 3 significant learning outcomes.
