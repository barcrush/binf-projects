#Abstract

Welcome to MyProjects library, here you will find a wide range of completed and/or ongoing projects related to Bioinformatics & Data science.

### 1. Model UNIGENE data
In this short project, we retrieve the UNIGENE file and devised a query software that generates gene information of various species and highlighted their expression profiles on different tissues (eg.: Humans, Horse, Sheep, etc.).


### 2. Mouse Protein Analysis
In the study, Expression levels of 77 proteins were measured in the cerebral cortex of 8 classes of control and Down syndrome mice exposed to context fear to condition, a task used to assess associative learning.
Essentially, we perfomed two analyses i.e., Feature subset (using PCA and Feature extraction) and Multi-classification study (using base and Ensemble learners) for 3 significant learning outcomes.
